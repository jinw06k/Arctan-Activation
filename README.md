# Arctan-Activation
CNN with Arctan as activation function

After learning about many different activation functions used in neural networks, I wondered why people never use the Arctan function (which looks just like the sigmoid function). Upon research, I soon realized its limitations, but I still decided to give it a try. Because... why not?
